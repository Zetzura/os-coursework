# Week 4 – Software Installation & Final Audit

## 1. Objective
The final week focused on installing system information tools to verify the server configuration and ensuring all packages are up to date for production use.

## 2. System Information Tool (Neofetch)
I installed **Neofetch**, a command-line system information tool, to provide a high-level overview of the server's environment.
* **Command used:** `sudo apt install neofetch -y`
* **Execution:** `neofetch`

*Above: Neofetch output displaying the Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS environment and hardware specs.*

## 3. Resource Audit Findings
Based on the final system check shown in the evidence:
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (Noble Numbat)
- **Kernel:** 6.8.0-90-generic
- **Memory:** 226MiB used out of 1967MiB (approx 2GB), showing an efficient idle state.
- **Uptime:** Verified at over 5 hours of stable operation.

## 4. Final Project Conclusion
The server is now fully configured, secured, and verified. All technical requirements for the OS deployment have been met, including user management, remote access via SSH, and firewall hardening.
